 * Description : VSCode properties file for C/C++ related configuration (include path, compiler path) to make intellisense works
 * Compiling with latest version of the ARM Toolchain doesn't seems to work (I tried with GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain 10.3-2021.10) 10.3.1 20210824 (release))
 * ChibiOS uses deprecated functionnalities of arm-none-eabi-gcc, errors during linking (sample of errors among many the linker doesn't find implementation of _exit _getpid _kill)
 * The only I found working is the one included with the eclipse epuck2 IDE (which is in my case placed under AppData/Local/Eclipse_e-puck2)
