 * File : IR_proximity.c
 * 
 * This file contains the function related to the IR proximity sensor.
 * We detect when we are about to hit an obstacle and the angle of the collision
 * 
 * TODO : write a function that check if any of the fron half circle sensors are triggered and return which one
 * (also be careful with false positive, ensure a certain level of confidence is reached between returning a value)
